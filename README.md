### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm Xabier, a bachelor's student in Universitat Autonoma de Barcelona, currently coursing the 4th year in [Nanoscience and Nanotechnology](https://www.uab.cat/web/estudiar/ehea-degrees/general-information/nanoscience-and-nanotechnology-1216708259085.html?param1=1263367118156) and 4th year in [Computational Mathematics and Data Analytics](https://www.uab.cat/web/estudiar/ehea-degrees/general-information-1216708259085.html?param1=1345740824235). Originary from the Basque Country, my passion is getting involved in interesting and enriching projects, to learn and get amazed with all the things this world has to show us. Part scientist (part mathematician, part physicist), part philosopher, and sure, part programmer. That's me.
