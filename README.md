### Hi there! 👋
I'm Xabier, a Bachelor's student at *Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona* (UAB), currently on the 4th year of [Nanoscience and Nanotechnology](https://www.uab.cat/web/estudiar/ehea-degrees/general-information/nanoscience-and-nanotechnology-1216708259085.html?param1=1263367118156) and 4th year of [Computational Mathematics and Data Analytics](https://www.uab.cat/web/estudiar/ehea-degrees/general-information-1216708259085.html?param1=1345740824235). 

Originary from the Basque Country, my passion is getting involved in interesting and enriching projects, to learn and get amazed with all the things this world has to show us. Part scientist, part philosopher, and sure, part ✨programmer✨. That's me!

#### Research Experience 📚
- 🗓️ July and August 2019, summer fellowship in Dr. Pol Forn’s Quantum Computing [Lab](http://quantic.bsc.es/team/) at the Institute for High Energy Physics [IFAE](https://www.ifae.es/).
    - An arbitrarily shaped pulse generator driver for Labber was built and an interface for the control of the Superconducting Qubit the group was engineering designed. https://github.com/UB-Quantic/Transmon-Operative-System

- 🗓️ 2019-2020 Bachelor's Thesis on the Quantum Many Body Problem with Dr. Jordi Mompart and Dr. Xavier Oriols at [UAB](https://www.uab.cat/web/universitat-autonoma-de-barcelona-1345467954774.html).
    - The thesis explores the problem employing Orthodox and Bohmian approaches. It includes a section where a new algorithm based on Bohmian Mechanics is suggested. https://github.com/Oiangu9/The_Quantum_Many_Body_Problem_-Bachelors_Thesis-

- 🗓️ 2020-2021 [QuantumCAT - QUASIBOHM](https://quantum-cat.cat/quantum-computing/quasibohm/) project:
    -  Worked with Dr. Guillem Albareda and Dr. Xavier Oriols on the method to simulate quantum dynamics using Bohmian conditional wavefunctions to approximate the Many Body problem, presented in the thesis. The found method is currently in process for a paper. https://github.com/Oiangu9/Bohmian_Research_Lab_QuantumCAT

- 🗓️ September 2021-present, Research Assistant at [Dr. Xavier Oriols' Group](http://europe.uab.es/xoriols/FrontPage.html) in UAB.
    - Developing algorithms to solve the Quantum Many Body Problem using non-orthodox interpretations of Quantum Mechanics.

- 🗓️ September 2021-present, Bachelor's Thesis with Dr. Àlex Turpin at the [Quantum and Atom Optics Group](https://grupsderecerca.uab.cat/qaos/) in UAB
    - Development from scratch of a state of the art polarimeter (both software and hardware), based on Conical Refraction. https://github.com/Oiangu9/Conical_Refraction_Polarimeter

#### Work Experience ⚙️
- 🗓️ July 2020 to January 2021, Data Scientist at [Kognia Sports Intelligence](https://kogniasports.com/):
    -  Designing intentionality prediction models for tactical situations in sports for the Analytics Team under the supervision of Dr. Hamish Silverwood.

- 🗓️ February 2021 and February 2022, lecturer and organizer at the Societat Catalana de Nanociència i Nanotecnologia ([SCN2](https://www.scn2.cat/)). 
    - 5 lecture long intensive Python Course for Scientific Programming. https://github.com/LLACorp/Python-Course-for-Scientific-Programming

 
#### Personal Projects ⚗️
- Based on a [paper](https://opg.optica.org/optica/fulltext.cfm?uri=optica-7-8-900&id=433965) published by Àlex Turpin et al., created a graphical user interface for 3D reconstruction with stereo images using OpenCV, in prder to transfer this capacity into a 1D sound detector. https://github.com/Oiangu9/Reconstructing_Space_with_Time

- Designed and implemented a self-motivated open source Quantum Dynamics Simulator software written in C++, for research and educational purposes. https://github.com/Oiangu9/XOA_QuantumDynamicsEngine
